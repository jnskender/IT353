          I am a current student at Illinois State University studying Information technology: Web Development Technology. This site has been created as part of a course assignment in IT353. I will use this site to satisfy the requirements of this assignment and
          use it to host live links for future assignments in this course.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a senior at this University and currently commute from Peoria, Illinois. I plan on graduating in May where I will <a href="#">pursue a career</a> in Web Development Technologies. I have a passion for the industry and am always researching
          new technologies that may help me increase my skills as a developer. I have experience with your standard from end technologies HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript/jQuery. On the backend I have built applications with C# and the .Net framework, ruby
          and the rails framework, and am recently in the process of researching and building a simple CRUD application with node.js and express.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of development I am an avid competitor in tennis, golf, and soccer. I have a passion for the outdoors and take fitness and health very seriously. I have a beautiful fiance of whom I have spent the last 8 years of my life with.
