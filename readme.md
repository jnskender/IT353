# IT 353 - Web Application Development

This repository will hold all files associated with this course. 

This website will be a work in progress throughout the duration of this course as I develop more skills in the field. 

I will use the website to practice skills learned in the course as well as to host all assignments with links to both live code and raw code. 

***

The site is hosted with github pages and can be [found here](https://jnskender.github.io/IT353/).

Raw code can be found inside of the [assignments folder](github.com/jnskender/it353/assignments).
